I finished reading Ray Dalio's new book, _Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail_. The book is reflection of his opinion about the changing power structure of nations. 

Over the past 500 years many powers had came and failed after some cyclic period. Dutch and British, they all thought that their power will continue like they are at peak. That didn't happen. Every time a new emerging country with more innovation and science takes over. They dominant country's reserve currency status, no longer holds due to large debt after excessive spending on better quality of life, wars, etc.

Right now, according to the book the US and China is in very critial position. China being on the way to be the leading power with it's huge military and technology. Even though China is little behind in AI chip, space and other areas of technology than US. They seems to be moving at very fast pace. With aggresive plans on 5G, AI, space and bio technology, it's probably and matter of 5 to 10 years that they become the leader.

As an Indian, it makes me sad that we probably won't be anything near China. After growing up listening to lot of promises about role of India in this century, I feel little disappointed in myself. But, whatever the power structure in the next few years I have the confidence that India will be doing incremental improvement in information technology, robotics, semiconductor manufacturing, phones and space frontiers. India will be in its own path of progress.
