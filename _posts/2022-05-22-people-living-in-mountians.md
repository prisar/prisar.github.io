Last month I went to mountain. It was amazing to see the beauty and magnificent scenes at high altitude. One the flip side it is very saddening to see how people live in the mountains.

Large amount of people live extremely difficult life. Many live in poverty, not having to send their children to schools. Even the basic things like bricks, are sold at much higher price.

Same goes to villages in China’s ‘Yi’ province. They are among the poorest people in China according to [Hezhimeng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgWZDvgW9OA). 
The documentary made by the Japanese director tries to describe some of the struggles of Yi people. Villagers have to climb steep slope of stairs everyday. 
It’s truly moving to see how much hope parents put on their children for escaping extreme poverty.
