title:  "Improved roads in our district"
---

In the past few years, the roads in our district and north bengal has seen phenomenal construction of roads. Like many parts of the country our 
district has also started getting the benifits of huge capital expenditure from both the goverments. Our district is the poorest among the whole of 
west bengal. For decades the northern west bengal is ignored due low economic activity. Even though most of the goods for north east india are 
transported through this area. 

### Window is opened
In future there is going to be many more highways and expressways in our nearby district. These will surely open up doors for opportunities. Our 
products can reach different parts of the country. Our jute products and textiles can be sold online through various platforms and channels. There 
is even possbility of sending goods to bangaldesh. As the standard of living in the country is increasing, the demand for good products will be high. 
My sense is that there will be big boost in economic activities due to roads and improving infastructure.
