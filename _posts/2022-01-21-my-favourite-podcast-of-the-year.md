title: my favourite podcast of the year
---
I have been a big fan of a few good podcasts. I listen to them daily or at least a dozen times weekly. 

Over the past few years, since apple podcasts became better - listening to podcasts very convenient. But my love for podcasts originates from my very early childhood. My dad used to listen to the radio every day for news, Bengali dramas, and scientific facts-based programs. All of these have played such an important part in upbringing too. So, I couldn’t get rid of my love for long audio conversations. 

Then, when I moved to Kolkata my window to the FM world opened. Suddenly I have been consuming every interesting conversation, music, science show, poem, narration, sports, etc on the radio. One of the shows which I liked particularly was a scientific discussion-based show called, “Bigyan Rashiker Dorobare” hosted by Dr. Manas Pratim Das. Every time I used to count the number of days and wait for that show, wonder about the topic for the next episode. Later, during my later years in college, I didn’t get to listen to the radio that much because of phones and the new craze for social media like Facebook, Whatsapp, etc on the internet. 

But now I feel like living those days all over again. So, the podcast I am talking about is by the name [Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSHZKyawb77ixDdsGog4iWA). Started as an artificial intelligence podcast and grew into more diverse towards science, engineering, wrestling. Most of the guests are not able people from their respective fields like Donald Knuth, Penrose, Elon, and many others. It had been my favorite pass time of previous among many others. Almost all the episodes are consumed listening and many are even repeated. There is so much depth in understanding the human condition, life, suffering, and science.
