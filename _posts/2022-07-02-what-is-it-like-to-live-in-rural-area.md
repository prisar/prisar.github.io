title:  "What is it like to live in rural area"
---

We all know living in a rural village is quite diffrent than living in urban cities. Its a mixed bag of experience. It comes with unique advantages 
and set of challanges too.
Our village is in a small pocket adjacent to Bangaladesh border. Nepal, Bhutan and China, also have their borders within 150km radius. Majority of 
the villagers are farmers with small percentage being working in cities.

### Labour rates

It's a well known trend to migrate from rural to urban as a country progress towards high per capita income and growth. This can be seen in many 
parts of the country. But for some reason people in our village and near by always return to agriculture after few years of work in cities. I dont 
know the eaxct reason. My sense is that they don't get enough money to live sustainably in cities. Living in village with their family is much cheaper. 
Children's grandparent help in raising kids. The labour rate is villages have increased due to government scheme and labour shortage. Now it's 350-400 rupees in our village. This is same as 10,000 per month which they get in cities. One negative about cities is the living expense is much higher.

### Government Schemes

In recent years there is vast array of government schemes both from central and state to support basic needs like health care, allowance, housing, banking 
etc. These has helped many people to send their childern to schools for better education. Even non-government school where the cost of education  relatively high. 

### Internet

With vast coverage of mobile broadband (MBB) access to internet is every parts of our village.
