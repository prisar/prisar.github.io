title: "Creating mobile apps for a low income region of India"
---

I have always wondered about the socio economic condition of northern part of west bengal. To be precise the district of uttar dinajpur. It has the lowest per capita income in west bengal. And this is the district where I am from. With decades of narrow minded politics have crippled the district. I don't want to engage in politics and yet I get reminded of their incompetenties everyday.

As a hobby I have been creating several apps for making online resouces be available to mobile users of our district. The apps are available in [playstore](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=7055530328789657723) and [github repositories](https://github.com/prisar)

#### Chakri
This is a my new app for exam related quizes. I have been busy with this app for no reason. 

The idea is to make an android only app. In native framework i.e. kotlin this time. I think it's time to get into a native devlopment, 
although react native is great framework. It made my journey to app development eaiser.
