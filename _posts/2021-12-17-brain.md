#### Human brain

Our brain is one of the most fascinating organ of our body. It is the only organ which can’t be artificially created unlike organs, like heart, blood cells.
Brain can never be turned off. Once it is turned off, everything is gone. There is no way of going back. Yet we don’t take care of as much we should.

Human brain is trully a marvelous and yet mysterious organ at the sametime. The more I read about it, the more I get intriged everyday.

I was watching a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3kXCC3h1dw) about a guy playing piano while undergoing surgery. You don't need to watch the video if you don't want to because of the surgery, I will explain. It is about a guy with brain tumor and doesn't loose his ability to play guitar. The doctor explains that a person's ability to play doesn't come from single part of the brain. So the skill is retained.
