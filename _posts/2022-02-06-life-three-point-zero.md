I have recently read a book, _Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence_ by Max Tegmark.

The book have profound questions on artificial intelligence. He breaks down lot of myths. 

He explains in detail lot of interesting questions.

What is life? 

Can machine have goals?

How many FLOPS are needed for human intelligence?

**Super star effect**

Only top writer, artist, gets the most wealth. Writer, J K Rolwing is more richer than Shakespere.

And, lot more...
